# hello-world

Ok a quick intro about myself. I love learning and I love technology. Currently,basic proficiency with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python, and Java are prime languages that I am picking up. I am hoping to find rewarding and challenging work as a new graduate from Auburn University. I would like to find a job that teaches me a lot as a person and in my career. I am a fast learner and a generally easy person to work with. 

Just making another edit. I figured I would give it another try.
